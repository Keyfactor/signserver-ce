Eclipse
=======
To build succesfully using Eclipse, there are .classpath and .project files in the package and in cvs. 
Simply check out Signserver and PrimeCard as projects and you're almost set. 
You must define the variable PRIMECARD_DIST in Window->Preferences->Java->Build Path->Classpath Variables 
(for example /home/tomas/workspace/java/dist-1.5).
Many classes are generated by XDoclet, so you must also do an 'ant' for Eclipse to find all classes needed
to build the project. After checking out the project, defining PRIMECARD_DIST and running 'ant', you should simply 
refresh the project in Eclipse and voila!
