DEVELOP
------

After checking out the project there will be errors in the IDE because some 
source files (i.e. Web Services stubs) has not been generated yet. Those errors 
will disappear after configuring and building SignServer.

See also the Developers page of the SignServer Wiki for the latest guidelines,
http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/signserver/index.php?title=Developers or 
click the Wiki link on http://www.signserver.org.


Eclipse
-------
To build successfully using Eclipse, there are .classpath and .project files in
the package and in the source code repository.
Checkout SignServer either using the Subversion CLI or as a project in Eclipse.
Simply check out SignServer as projects and you are almost set. 
Web service stubs for test classes are generated when the tests are built. To 
get rid of all build errors in Eclipse you need to build classes and tests: 
$ bin/ant clean build test:compile
Then do a Refresh and Clean and Build in the IDE.


NetBeans IDE
------------
There are multiple NetBeans IDE projects for SignServer. The project 
modules/SignServer-Project is a NetBeans IDE FreeForm project that uses the
Ant-scripts for building and includes the sources from most modules. In addition 
each module has its own project under the folder modules/ that can be opened 
with NetBeans IDE.

The SignServer AdminGUI uses the Swing Application Framework and requires 
NetBeans IDE =7.0.x for changing some of the GUI parts.

For the 3.2 branch don't let a newer version than 7.0.x update the build scripts
as we only require Ant 1.7.1.

For trunk newer versions can be used as we require Ant 1.8.1 or later and 
we target NetBeans IDE 8.0.

When the projects are first opened there might be a missing dependency 
"clover.jar". This will go away after building the project.


Writing Documentation
---------------------
The SignServer documentation is built using Apache Anakia/Velocity from XML 
source files under modules/SignServer-Doc/src/xdocs/ when running 
"bin/ant doc".

The file manual/complete.en.xml contains the source for all chapters in the 
manual.


Automated Tests
---------------
SignServer uses JUnit for automated testing. Test cases exists in multiple 
projects. Which tests are included in the default suite is defined by the 
property "tests.modules.includes" in modules/modules-project.properties.

This is roughly how tests are currently organized:
* Each new module can include its own Unit tests.
* Some components (i.e. web services) uses their own test projects 
  (SignServer-Test-*WS) to not have to include client-side code in their 
  projects.
* Legacy tests and system tests are placed in SignServer-Test-System.

See also the "Testing" chapter of the manual for the prerequisites and 
instructions for how to run the tests. 


Test coverage with Clover
-------------------------

To run Clover, copy the Clover installation folder (or make a symlink to it) 
and store it as lib/ext/clover-dir. If the project has been built already an 
dummy Clover folder will already exist with that name so you will have to 
remove it first.

$ bin/ant clean clover.clean build deploy
$ bin/ant ant test:run

Stop the application server and then run the following to gather the report:
$ ant clover.xml clover.html

To disable Clover even if it is installed run Ant with -Dno.clover=true.


Admin GUI Development
---------------------
The SignServer AdminGUI is implemented using the Swing Application Framework 
(JSR 296) and requires NetBeans IDE 7.0 if you want to do GUI changes. Since 
JSR 296 didn't make it into the JDK, support for it was dropped in later 
versions of the IDE.


Code Conventions
----------------

We are loosely trying to follow the old Sun/Oracle Code Conventions for the 
Java TM Programming Language:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconvtoc-136057.html

Some of the rules:
- The code should be properly indented
- We use spaces (not tabs) for indention, the IDE:s can be configured to use this
- Opening curly braces ("{") should not be on there own line. Example "if (true) {"
- First sentence in JavaDoc ends with a period ".". Example /** The signature algorithm. */
- TODO: Add more here
