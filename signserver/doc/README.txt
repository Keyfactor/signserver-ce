SignServer README

This document contains some notes on how to get
started with using the SignServer.

There are two open office documents in this directory, the first
one describing how to install and configure the SignServer and the
other one explains how to use and develop applications using the framework.

It recommended that you first read at the SignServer web site
at www.signserver.org. It contains the most recent information about
the framework. It is also possible to build the web site locally using ant
and the task 'ant doc'. The generated documentation will be placed in the directory
'tmp/htdocs'.
