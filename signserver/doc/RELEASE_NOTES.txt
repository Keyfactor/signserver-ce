SignServer 3.3.0
----------------

Major changes:
 - Drop support for JBoss 4.2.x.

TODO


Notice:
 - Apache Ant 1.8.0 or later is now required to build SignServer.
 - The property "custom.commandfactory" is no longer supported. See the manual 
   for how to add custom Admin or Client CLI commands.
 - The Admin CLI now ignores the "-host" argument if present.
 - The default archiver called OldDatabaseArchiver has changed the format of
   the data part of the XML serialized ArchiveData from an byte array to a 
   base64 encoded String. The change is transparent for Java clients using
   SignServer-Common.jar for parsing the ArchiveData but other clients might 
   need to be updated.
 - As an alternative to the OldDatabaseArchiver a new archiver called 
   Base64DatabaseArchiver can also be used.


SignServer 3.2.3
----------------

Major new features and improvements:
 - Support for SignServer without database
 - Configurable to disable the key usage counter
 - Signer certificate check in Health check for all Signers
 - Check that the timestamp signer certificate is included in the certificate chain
 - Health check response of TimeStampSigner now considers status of time source
 - Down-for-maintenance support in Health check
 - Support for supplying filename as request metadata

Bug fixes:
 - Client CLI only supported 10 arguments on Windows
 - Null value was inserted when removing last wsadmin on Oracle
 - PDF Signature could not be larger than 15000 bytes
 - Sample configuration for renewal worker not functional
 - Various documentation updates

Notice:
 - Same internal API changes has been done as part of DSS-528. If you have 
   custom code some changes might be required.

SignServer 3.2.2
----------------

Major new features and improvements:
 - Support for denying timestamp requests unless the time source is considered
   in sync
 - Support for dispatching timestamp requests to different timestamp 
   units/signers
 - Support for accessing workers using the /worker/* URL pattern gives easier 
   filtering with a proxy
 - Signer's status report can now be offered by a worker and not just a timed 
   service
 - The log field PROCESS_SUCCESS can now have the value "false" if a request 
   failed
 - Hostname displayed in title bar of AdminGUI simplifies when managing multiple 
   servers

Bug fixes:
 - Build failure on W7 X64
 - Sample code using web services should use HTTPS
 - URL for documentation only working with JBoss 4 

Notice:
 - Support for the cluster classloader has been deprecated and support for it 
   will be dropped in a future release.
 - The status property "INSYNC" is now called "TIMESOURCE0_INSYNC". Applications 
   relaying on the name of this property should be updated.
 - The time stamp signer will now log PROCESS_SUCCESS with the value false
   in case the response has a status other than GRANTED.

 - Improved API for archiving
 - Support for signing PDFs with document restrictions
 - Support for PDF permissions enforcement
 - Support for modifying PDF permissions
 - Support for setting a PDF permissions password
 - Refuse to certify PDFs already certified and refuse to sign when signing is 
   not allowed

Bug fixes:

 - Warnings printed on STDERR
 - Web service interface did not log XFORWARDEDFOR headers
 - Typo in sample configuration for PDFSigner
 - Setting healthcheck properties had no effect
 - CRL download should close streams correctly and allow for caching
 - Supplied username and password ignored in SigningAndValidationWS
 - Unit tests failed in certain situations
 - Ant target for testing individual tests did not work
 - Switching application server type did not update jndi.properties    
 - JavaDoc failed to build




Notice:
 - In signserver_build.properties the property "useclusterclassloader" now 
   defaults to false. To still use the deprecated clusterclassloader this 
   needs to be set explicitly to true.
 - In signserver_build.properties the property "includemodulesinbuild" now 
   defaults to true. To not have all modules built in this needs to be set to 
   explicitly to false.
 - The fix of DSS-371 introduced a change in the EJB interface. Applications 
   using that interface should run version >=3.2.1 on both client and server 
   side.
