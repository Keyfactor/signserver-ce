SignServer 3.7.0
----------------

New features:
 - Indivual keys. Key aliases in crypto tokens can be selected by workers at
   run-time based on the incoming request using the new AliasSelector interface.
   An implementation selecting aliases based on the authenticated user of the
   request is included.

Improvements:

Bug fixes:
 - Crypto token operations in the administration GUI does not require clicking
   outside of the last edited input field to be able to performe the action
   (i.e. when generating keys).

Notice:
 - The SignServer build/deployment configuration file has been renamed from
   signserver_build.properties to signserver_deploy.properties. When upgrading
   from an earlier version the existing configuration file should be renamed
   accordingly. The Ant script will complain if a file with the old name is
   found.
 - The XML Security library has been updated to version 1.5.8 and its 
   dependency to version 2.7.2.
   This fixes a potential security vulnerability in earlier versions.
   See: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0107
   See also the various "Fix XML Security library issue" sections in the
   Install Guide for the extra steps needed when using JBoss 5, 7 and EAP 
   respectively.
 - The new KeystoreInConfigCryptoToken is not supported under GlassFish 2.
 - HardCodedCryptoToken is no longer supported for most use cases. Previously,
   the token could have been configured in Certificate or Document validators
   as those required a token to function. Since long this has not been
   required and if any of your validators has this token configured it should
   be removed or they might give an error.
 - SoftCryptoToken is no longer supported. The token was mainly used for quick
   demo setups but does not support the API in 3.7. Use KeystoreCryptoToken or
   KeystoreInConfigCryptoToken instead.
 - The KeystoreCryptoToken will no longer use the first available key when
   signing if DEFAULTKEY has not been set. Please configure your
   KeystoreCryptoTokens to have a DEFAULTKEY property set.
   Having a defined DEFAULTKEY is not needed if using runtime-decided keys
   (using the AliasSelector interfaces).
 - The old way of specifying PKCS#11 libraries by referencing the path to the
   dynamic library as a worker property for a crypto worker has been
   deprecated in favor of using named library definitions.
   To continue using the old way, you need to make sure there is a defined
   named library using the same path as manually specified by the worker.
   If the library is not among the pre-defined libraries, it is possible to
   add new definitions in the deploy properties.
   For security reasons, it is also possible to disable any of the pre-defined
   library definitions.

See ChangeLog.txt for the full list of changes.
