SignServer 3.3.0
----------------

TODO


Notice:
 - Apache Ant 1.8.0 or later is now required to build SignServer.
 - The property "custom.commandfactory" is no longer supported. See the manual 
   for how to add custom Admin or Client CLI commands.
 - The Admin CLI now ignores the "-host" argument if present.

SignServer 3.2.2
----------------

Notice:
 - The time stamp signer will now log PROCESS_SUCESS with the value false
   in case the response has a status other than GRANTED.

SignServer 3.2.1
----------------

Major new features and improvements:

 - Improve servlet error handling
 - Deploy documentation with application
 - Improved API for archiving
 - Support for signing PDFs with document restrictions
 - Support for PDF permissions enforcement
 - Support for modifying PDF permissions
 - Support for setting a PDF permissions password
 - Refuse to certify PDFs already certified and refuse to sign when signing is 
   not allowed

Bug fixes:
 - Remote EJB worker interface could not be used with ECC with explicit parameters
 - Warnings printed on STDERR
 - Web service interface did not log XFORWARDEDFOR headers
 - Typo in sample configuration for PDFSigner
 - Setting healthcheck properties had no effect
 - CRL download should close streams correctly and allow for caching
 - Supplied username and password ignored in SigningAndValidationWS
 - Unit tests failed in certain situations
 - Ant target for testing individual tests did not work
 - Switching application server type did not update jndi.properties    
 - JavaDoc failed to build




Notice:
 - In signserver_build.properties the property "useclusterclassloader" now 
   defaults to false. To still use the deprecated clusterclassloader this 
   needs to be set explicitly to true.
 - In signserver_build.properties the property "includemodulesinbuild" now 
   defaults to true. To not have all modules built in this needs to be set to 
   explicitly to false.
 - The fix of DSS-371 introduced a change in the EJB interface. Applications 
   using that interface should run version >=3.2.1 on both client and server 
   side.
