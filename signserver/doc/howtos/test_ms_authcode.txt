Instructions for testing the MS Authenticode Time Stamp signer
===============================================================

Install the signer using the doc/sample-configs/qs_ms_authcode_timestamp_configuration.properties.

Install the Microsoft SDK on a Windows machine (I used XP in VirtualBox).
This can be downloaded from: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/dlx/en-us/listdetailsview.aspx?FamilyID=6b6c21d2-2006-4afa-9702-529fa782d63b
The download is labelled "for Windows 7", but it works on XP as well.
I also had to install the .Net runtime: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/dlx/en-us/default.aspx?FamilyID=9CFB2D51-5FF4-4491-B0E5-B386F32C0992

After installing the SDK you can open a command prompt go to the Bin directory within the SDK:
cd C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin

Now run the signtool (I used one of the .exe files in this directory as an example, the IP address in the example below is the bridged one used by
VirtualBox to access the host, modify as needed):
signtool.exe timestamp /t http://10.0.2.2:8080/signserver/tsa?workerName=MSAuthCodeTimeStampSigner AccEvent.exe

After this you can manually inspect the certificate stored in the .exe file (AccEvent.exe) by navigating to the folder in the file explorer
and right-click on the file select "Properties".
Now select the "Digital Signatures" tab. Select the certificate and click on "Details".
You can now select the Timestamp signature under "Countersignatures" and click "Details" to view the signature.
