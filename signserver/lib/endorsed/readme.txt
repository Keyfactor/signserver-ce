NOTE : signserver.sh and signserver.cmd specify -Djava.endorsed.dirs=lib/endorsed when running. This is done for runtime to pick the jars in this directory instead of equivalent (but maybe outdated jars) in classpath (as is the case with xmlsec). Ant copies the jars in this directory to JBOSS_HOME/lib/endorsed so jboss does the same when running. openxml4j-signaturepatched.jar is placed in same directory as xmlsec is, since it implements TransformServiceProvider and Classloader needs it to be in same place as xmlsec .
