<p>
There are three kind of processable services.
</p> 
<ul>
<li>Signers (used to sign or in other way  process requested data). </li>
<li>Validation Services used to verify the validity of a certificate against a set of backed issuers. The validation service can be used to simply the integration of PKIs into existing applications. </li>
</ul>
<p> 
In addition to processable services there also exists another concept called Timed Service which are plug-ins run at defined intervals performing maintenance or reporting routines.
</p>
<p>
Out-of-the-box are there several signers ready to be used. They can easily be configured after installation of SignServer. 
</p>
<p>
The main way of communicating with the SignServer is through the web server interface or using the client web services (WS) interface.
</p>
<p>
Administration is done through a command-line interface where properties and access controls can be configured or using the Admin GUI remotely over the Admin web services (WS) interface.
</p>
<p>
One instance of SignServer can have multiple signers for different purposes.
