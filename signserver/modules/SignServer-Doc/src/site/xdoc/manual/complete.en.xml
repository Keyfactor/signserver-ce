The SignServer is an application framework performing cryptographic operations
for other applications. It's intended to be used in environments where keys are
supposed to be protected in hardware but it isn't possible to connect such
hardware to existing enterprise applications or where the operations are
considered extra sensitive so the hardware have to protected more carefully.
Another usage is to provide a simplified method to provide signatures in
different application managed from one location in the company.
                </p>
                <p>
The SignServer have been designed for high-availability and can be clustered for maximum
reliability.
                </p>
                <p>
The SignServer comes with a RFC 3161 compliant Time-Stamp signer serving requests through
HTTP or client-authenticated HTTPS. A MRTD (Machine Readable Travel Document, i.e. electronic
passport) signer. A PDF signer that adds a signature automatically to a uploaded PDF document,
ODF signer that adds a signature automatically to uploaded ODF document, OOXML Signer that
adds signature automatically to a uploaded OOXML document, and a validation service used to
lookup the validation of a given certificate.

            <section name="Overall Architecture">
                    <p>
The SignServer is a framework designed to perform different kind of cryptographic operations for different applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
Since the 3.0 version there are three kind of processable services. Signers (used to sign or in other way  process requested data). Validation Services used to verify the validity of a certificate against a set of backed issuers. The validation service can be used to simply the integration of PKIs into existing applications. In addition to processable services there also exists another concept called Timed Service (called just 'service' in 2.0 edition) which are plug-ins run at defined intervals performing maintenance or reporting routines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
The main way of communicating with the SignServer is through HTTP (web server) interface. There is also a web services (SOAP WS) interface available but that uses a special binary format for encoding the requests and responses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
For an overview of the different concepts in the SignServer see illustration 1. The base component is called Worker which is assigned an id, optionally a name and a configuration. A sub component is a Processable which receives and processes requests. A Processable (optionally) have access to a cryptographic token (CryptoToken) in charge of managing the keys of a Processable. A CryptoToken can be either software or hardware based.
                    </p>
                    <p>
The applications i administrated through a command-line interface, where the properties and access control can be configured.
                    </p>
                    <p>
One SignServer can have multiple services for different purposes.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Java 6: OpenJDK 6 or Oracle JDK 6 Update 10 or later*<br/>
                            Java 7: OpenJDK 7** or Oracle JDK 7*</li>
                        <li>Application server: JBoss 5.1.0.GA***, JBoss EAP 5.1, JBoss AS 7.1.1, JBoss EAP 6.1 or GlassFish Server Open Source Edition 2.1.1 or 3.1.2</li>
                        <li>Database: MySQL or MariaDB 5.5, HypersonicSQL (bundled with JBoss 5), Oracle Database 10/11g or without****</li>
                        <li>Build tool: Apache Ant 1.8.0 or later</li>

                    <p>
* When using Oracle JDK you must install the 'Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files' for JDK for the parts of SignServer that  makes use of strong crypto to work. The policy files can be found at the same place as the JDK download at Oracle. Further information on this can be found in the Oracle documentation on the JCE. <br/>
** If the application server supports JDK 7. Works for GlassFish 3 and JBoss 7/EAP 6.<br/>
*** JBoss 5.1.0.GA is available in two different versions (standard and JDK6) which differs in web services stacks. The one called JBoss 5.1.0.GA-JDK6 should be used.<br/>

Skip this section and instead follow the instructions in

you decide to run SignServer without a database management system.

Create a database and user for SignServer. The application server will try to
create tables during startup of SignServer but if the database user does not
have table create permissions or if you run on GlassFish the tables must be
created manually. See doc/sql-scripts/create-tables-signserver34-*.sql.

                    <subsubsection name="Configure database driver for JBoss AS 7 or JBoss EAP 6">
<p>
In JBoss 7/EAP6 it is not enough to just drop the JAR archive with a database JDBC driver into the deployments directory. Instead you will have to perform the following steps (for MySQL or MariaDB):
<ol>
<li>Create the necessary directories (relative to JBoss 7 base directory):
<br/>
On JBoss 7.1.1 or EAP 6.0:
<pre>
mkdir -p modules/com/mysql/main/
</pre>
On JBoss 7.2 or EAP 6.1:
<pre>
mkdir -p modules/system/layers/base/com/mysql/main/
</pre>
Or for MariaDB, mariadb-java-client-1.1.2.jar:
<pre>
mkdir -p modules/org/mariadb/main/
</pre>
On JBoss 7.2 or EAP 6.1:
<pre>
mkdir -p modules/system/layers/base/org/mariadb/main/
</pre>
</li>
<li>Place the mysql.jar or mariadb.jar file in the directory you just created.</li>
<li>Create, in the created directory, the JDBC module configuration file module.xml with the following contents (replace mysql.jar with the full name of your jar file for example mysql-connector-java-5.1.18-bin.jar):
<pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;module xmlns=&quot;urn:jboss:module:1.0&quot; name=&quot;com.mysql&quot;&gt;
  &lt;resources&gt;
    &lt;resource-root path=&quot;mysql.jar&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/resources&gt;
  &lt;dependencies&gt;
    &lt;module name=&quot;javax.api&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;module name=&quot;javax.transaction.api&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/module&gt;
<!-- This is the original of above XML text.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<module xmlns="urn:jboss:module:1.0" name="com.mysql">
  <resources>
    <resource-root path="mysql.jar"/>
  </resources>
  <dependencies>
    <module name="javax.api"/>
    <module name="javax.transaction.api"/>
  </dependencies>
</module>
-->
</pre>
Or for MariaDB, mariadb-java-client-1.1.2.jar:
<pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;module xmlns=&quot;urn:jboss:module:1.0&quot; name=&quot;org.mariadb&quot;&gt;
  &lt;resources&gt;
    &lt;resource-root path=&quot;mariadb-java-client-1.1.2.jar&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/resources&gt;
  &lt;dependencies&gt;
    &lt;module name=&quot;javax.api&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;module name=&quot;javax.transaction.api&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/module&gt;
</pre>

</li>
<li>Register the driver by running the following two commands in the JBoss 7 CLI administration tool:
<pre>
/subsystem=datasources/jdbc-driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver:add(driver-name=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver,driver-module-name=com.mysql,driver-xa-datasource-class-name=com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlXADataSource)
:reload
</pre>
Or for MariaDB, mariadb-java-client-1.1.2.jar:
<pre>
/subsystem=datasources/jdbc-driver=org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver:add(driver-name=org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver,driver-module-name=org.mariadb,driver-xa-datasource-class-name=org.mariadb.jdbc.MySQLDataSource)
:reload
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>For PostgreSQL you would use the following values instead:
<pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;module xmlns=&quot;urn:jboss:module:1.0&quot; name=&quot;org.postgresql&quot;&gt;
  &lt;resources&gt;
    &lt;resource-root path=&quot;postgresql-9.1-903.jdbc4.jar&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/resources&gt;
  &lt;dependencies&gt;
    &lt;module name=&quot;javax.api&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;module name=&quot;javax.transaction.api&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/module&gt;
</pre>
<pre>
/subsystem=datasources/jdbc-driver=org.postgresql.Driver:add(driver-name=org.postgresql.Driver,driver-module-name=org.postgresql,driver-xa-datasource-class-name=org.postgresql.xa.PGXADataSource)
:reload
</pre>

a JKS SSL server keystore. Rename the web server keystore to tomcat.jks and put
it in a 'p12' subdirectory. Place a keystore called truststore.jks in the 'p12' directory
containing the trusted root certificate(s).

If you are using Oracle's JDK and JBoss 5.1.x you need to copy

when it's time for upgrades! This is a bug tracked by JBoss as JBAS-7882.

                        <p>
JBoss 7/EAP 6 isolates away most sun classes. That means you will not be able to send certificates through remote EJB calls, and will not be able to use the Sun PKCS#11 provider.
These classes can be made available by editing the file
<i>modules/sun/jdk/main/module.xml (JBoss 7.1/EAP6.0)</i> and adding the following packages to the list of system export paths:
                        </p>
                        <source>
&lt;path name="sun/security/x509"/&gt;

&lt;path name="sun/security/pkcs11/wrapper"/&gt;
                        </source>
                        <p>
This will allow an application to use these internal Sun/Oracle/OpenJDK classes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
This is not needed in JBoss EAP 6.1/JBoss 7.2, because the two first packages are exported by default since <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBPAPP6-1748">JBPAPP6-1748</a>.
One package is however needed still. In JBoss EAP 6.1 the file is located in <i>modules/system/layers/base/sun/jdk/main/module.xml</i>.

                <subsection name="Quick start demo XML validator">
                    <p>
An XML validator validates the signature of an XML document. It uses a
certificate validation service worker for validating the certificate so
that worker has to be configured first.
                    </p>
                    <p>
To install a certificate validation service worker issue the following commands:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
Load the configuration and notice the worker ID (in this example: 6):<br/>
<code>$ bin/signserver setproperties doc/sample-configs/qs_validator_dummy_configuration.properties</code>
                        </li>
                        <li>
Activate the configuration with:<br/>
<code>$ bin/signserver reload 6</code>
<br/>
                        </li>
                        <li>
The status of the Worker can now be viewed with:<br/>
<code>$ bin/signserver getstatus complete CertValidationWorker</code>
<br/>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
Then to install the XML validator you can issue the following commands:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
Make sure the xmlvalidator module is built in by setting module.xmlvalidator.enabled=true and
module.xmlvalidator.include=true in signserver_build.properties before building and
deploying SignServer. Alternativly, set includemodulesinbuild=true to have all
modules built in.
                        </li>
                        <li>
Load the XML validator demo configuration and notice the generated worker ID (in this
example 7):
<br/>$ bin/signserver setproperties doc/sample-configs/qs_xmlvalidator_configuration.properties
                        </li>
                    <li>
Verify the configuration with (notice that VALIDATIONSERVICEWORKER is set to "CertValidationWorker"):<br/>
<code>$ bin/signserver getconfig 7</code>
<br/>
                    </li>
                    <li>
Activate the configuration with:<br/>
<code>$ bin/signserver reload 7</code>
<br/>
                    </li>
                    <li>
The status of the Validator can now be viewed with:<br/>
<code>$ bin/signserver getstatus complete DemoXMLValidator</code>
<br/>
                    </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
Now <a href="integration.html">the SignServer APIs</a> can be used to request XML documents to be validated by the DemoXMLValidator worker.
                    </p>
                </subsection>

                <subsection name="Quick start demo MRTD SOD signer">
                    <p>
The MRTD SOD signer takes as input data group hashes and creates a signed SO(d). This means that the signserver will function
as a Document Signer for ePassports.</p>
                    <p>
To install the MRTD SOD signer you can issue the following commands:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
Make sure the mrtdsodsigner module is built in by setting module.mrtdsodsigner.enabled=true and
module.mrtdsodsigner.include=true in signserver_build.properties before building and
deploying SignServer. Alternativly, set includemodulesinbuild=true to have all
modules built in.
                        </li>
                        <li>
Load the MRTD SOD signer demo configuration and notice the generated worker ID (in this
example 8):<br/>
<code>$ bin/signserver setproperties doc/sample-configs/qs_mrtdsodsigner_configuration.properties</code>
                        </li>
                        <li>
Activate the configuration with:<br/>
<code>$ bin/signserver reload 8</code><br/>
                        </li>
                        <li>
The status of the signer can now be viewed with:<br/>
<code>$ bin/signserver getstatus complete mrtdsodsigner</code><br/>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
Now <a href="integration.html">the SignServer APIs</a> can be used to send MRTD SOD sign requests the MRTDSODSigner.
<br/>
Also you can use the HTML page <a href="http://localhost:8080/signserver/demo/mrtdsodsign.jsp">http://localhost:8080/signserver/demo/mrtdsodsign.jsp</a> to enter requests and get the SOd back.
This HTML form also functions as a sample to show how you can make HTTP requests from the personalisation system to the Document Signer.

                    <subsubsection name="Production configuration with HSM">
                        <p>
To install a production signer using an HSM instead of the demo signer you can
edit doc/sample-configs/qs_mrtdsodsigner_configuration.properties and change from
SoftCryptoToken to PKCS11CryptoToken and comment all properties under
SoftCryptoToken properties and instead fill in all properties under
PKCS11CryptoToken properties and then run:
<br/>(note after changing properties in the file it needs to be loaded again
with setproperties)
                        </p>
                        <p>
Before starting with an HSM installation you should read the about the
<a href="plugins.html#PKCS11CryptoToken">PKCS11CryptoToken</a> in the plugins
section of the manual.
                        </p>
<source>
bin/signserver setproperties doc/sample-configs/qs_mrtdsodsigner_configuration.properties
bin/signserver getconfig 9
bin/signserver reload 9
bin/signserver activatecryptotoken 9 tokenpin
bin/signserver generatecertreq 9 "C=SE,CN=MRTD SOD Signer" SHA256WithRSA mrtdsodsigner.req
</source>
                        <p>
Where 9 is the signerId that you got when running the 'setproperties' command.<br/>
Tokenpin is the password for the HSM slot configured in the properties file.<br/>
This will create a certificate request that you can get signed by your CA. When you have received the response you can import it and the CA certficate.
If you have the returned signer certificate as cert.pem and the CA certificate as cacert.pem, then:
                        </p>
<source>
cat cert.pem cacert.pem &gt; certchain.pem
bin/signserver uploadsignercertificate 9 glob cert.pem
bin/signserver uploadsignercertificatechain 9 glob certchain.pem
bin/signserver reload 9

                        <p>
Hint: you can use EJBCA to create keys on a PKCS#11 HSM using clientToolBox.<br/>

            <section name="Configuration/Administration">
                <p>
The SignServer administration command line interface (Admin CLI) is started
using bin/signserver (or bin/signserver.cmd).
                </p>
                <p>
Every worker is identified by an ID and an optional name that can be used in all
the CLI commands.
                </p>
                <p>
It is possible to do configuration of a worker while it's in production. All
configuration commands are cached until a reload command is issued and the
configuration becomes active.
                </p>
                <p>
There is a special property file for the cli interface called signserver_cli.properties defining which nodes that exists in the cluster. The properties are:
                </p>
                <p>
<b>hostname.masternode</b> = Should only contain one of the nodes, specified as the default master node. Used by operations dealing with the database and where not all nodes in the cluster needs to be contacted. It is possible to override this setting in the CLI by using the -host &lt;host name&gt; parameter.
                </p>
                <p>
<b>hostname.allnodes</b> = Should contain all the nodes in the cluster, separated by a ';'. Mainly used by the commands getStatus, activateCryptoToken and deactivateCryptoToken.
                </p>
                <p>
Its possible to customize the CLI with your own code. How to do this is described in the development section.

                        <p><b>Authorization Related</b></p>
                        <p>
These commands are used to configure the internal client certificate authorization when it is turned on. It controls which clients that is authorized to request a processable worker.
                        </p>
                        <p>
<b>addauthorizedclient:</b>
Adds a client certificate to a processable workers list of acceptable clients using this worker. Specify
certificate serial number in hex and the Issuer DN of the client certificate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
<b>removeauthorizedclient:</b>
Removes added client certificate entries.
                        </p>
                        <p>

<b>resync:</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
The 'resync' command is used after a SignServer had a complete database failure. When this happens  will the Global Configuration become in 'Off-line' mode and it's not possible for the nodes to communicate internally and the Global Configurations will not be in sync any more. After the database is up again can this command be sent to the node that have the most valid Global Configuration and write it to the database. After this will the Global Configuration be in 'On-line' mode again.
                        </p>

                        <p>
This commands can be used for processable workers that have archiving turned on. They 
are used to find specific archived responses. It's up to the implementation of the 
worker if it supports archiving or not and it is up to the chosen Archiver if it 
archives the data in way that it can be queried using this commands. For Archivers 
other than the default "OldDatabaseArchiver" and Base64DatabaseArchiver querying 
might have to be done directly in a database, filesystem or by some custom 
application.

                <subsection name="Database CLI">
                    <p>
The SignServer Database CLI uses Java Persistence API (JPA) to connect to the 
SignServer database. The CLI is configured by the dbcli.* properties in 
signserver_cli.properties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
The CLI needs to have the JDBC driver of the selected database available on the 
classpath. This can be achieved by setting the OPTIONAL_CLASSPATH environment 
variable when calling the bin/signserver-db script or by putting the JAR under
lib/ext/jdbc/ and calling it jdbc.jar. The last method is required to be able 
to run the JUnit tests. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
Sample usage:
                    </p>
                    <source>
bin/signserver-db audit
                    </source>
                    <subsubsection name="Verify Auditlog Command">
                        <source>
Usage: verifylog -all
       verifylog [-node NODENAME[:OFFSET] ...]

Verifies logs from all nodes starting at sequence number 0 or only from the specified nodes and optional sequence number offsets specified.
If the nodename is suffixed with a colon and an number then the verification for that node is started from that sequence number.
The JDBC connector of the database might have to be put on the classpath. See the example below.

Example: a) signserver-db audit verifylog -all
Example: b) signserver-db audit verifylog -node server1 -node server2:708
Example: c) OPTIONAL_CLASSPATH=/usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar signserver-db audit verifylog -all
                        </source>
                        <p>
The command can be run to verify the signature of every entry in the auditlog 
as well as checking the sequence number in order to make sure that it does not 
contain any gaps.
                        </p>
                        <p>
The keys used to verify the log are configured in conf/databaseprotection.properties.

                    <subsubsection name="Archiving of the audit log">
                        <p>
As the Database CLI audit verifylog command checks for gabs in the sequence numbering entries from the audit log can not be archived/moved to other storage without special care.
However since the command now supports the option to specify from which sequence number to start the verification the following scheme for archiving is proposed:                            
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
Run the command to verify the complete log audit log:
<pre class="code">audit verifylog -all</pre>
Note down the last sequence number for each node. Ie:
<pre class="code">Last sequences: {server1=2, server2=7}</pre>
                            </li>
                            <li>
All entries from 0 up to the entry before the last can now be archived and removed from the database. In our example that would be entry 0 and 1 for node server1 and entries from 0 to 6 for node server2.                                
                            </li>
                            <li>
The next time the log should be verified start the verification from the last sequence numbers:
<pre class="code">audit verifylog -node server1:2 -node server2:7</pre>
Again note down the last sequence number for each node and all entries up to the sequence number before the last for each node can now be archived.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <note>
It is important to not remove the row with the last sequence number for any node as if the application is restarted the sequence numbering would than start again from 0 for that node.
                        </note>

                    <p>
In SignServer operations are performed by workers. There can be many workers 
and each worker has its own configuration. Each worker is identified by an unique 
ID. A worker can also be configured with a name by setting the property NAME. 
After the configuration has been activated (by issuing reload with the worker ID) 
that name can also be used to address the worker.

                    <subsubsection name="Configuring">
                        <p>
A worker is configured by setting properties for it. Specifically if the plugin
is built-in it is specified by setting the property CLASSPATH to the fully
qualified name of the class implementing the plugin.
                        </p>
                        <p>
The properties can be set manually using the setproperty command or by loading
them all at once from a configuration file using the setproperties command.
Sample configuration files are available in SIGNSERVER_HOME/sample-configs.

                        <p>

            <section name="Making the SignServer highly-available">
                <p>
Here are some tips on configuration used to make the SignServer redundant. Usually is the SignServer set-up with three nodes (required minimum for MySQL cluster) where one node is a management node from were all deployment and administration is done and the other two services are service nodes processing the actual requests.
                </p>
                
                <subsection name="HTTP access requires a load balancer">
                    <p>
HTTP based workers like the TSA can be clustered using a load balancer accessing a health check servlet returning the state of the SignServer. The basic settings of the health check servlet can be configured in the build configuration file but more advanced settings are done in 'src/web/healthcheck/WEB-INF/web.xml'. With the default settings will the servlet return the text 'ALLOK' when accessing the URL http://localhost:8080/signserver/healthcheck/signserverhealth. If something is wrong with the sign server will an error message be sent back instead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
The health check servlet can also be used to monitor the SignServer by creating a script that monitors the URL periodically for error messages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
Tip, heartbeat with ldirectord is a good solution for a load balancer and works well with the SignServer. KeepAlived is another open source solution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
The Main WebService using the Java client API manages the HA parts itself and then isn't a load balancer necessary.

                   <subsubsection name="Setting up the Health check servlet">
                    <p>
In SignServer there exists a health check service that can be used for health monitoring. It is also useful for cluster, as it can be checked by load balancers to determine if a node should be active in the cluster (healthy) or taken out of the cluster (unhealthy).
                    </p>
                    <p>
The servlet is located at the URL: http://localhost:8080/signserver/healthcheck/signserverhealth and configured in signserver_build.properties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
The following configuration parameters may be set to configure authorization and what the service checks: 
                    </p>
                    <p>
<source>healthcheck.authorizedips</source> - A semicolon-delimited list of IP addresses authorized to access
the healthcheck servlet, if the list contains the keyword "ANY", any IP address is authorized access (defaults to <source>127.0.0.1</source>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
<source>healthcheck.minimumfreememory</source> - Number of megabytes of memory that must be free before removing     
the node out of the cluster (defaults to 1).
                    </p>
                    <p>
<source>healthcheck.checkdbstring</source> - The string that should be used to do 
a minimal check that the database is working. May differ between databases.
(defaults to <source>Select count(*) from signerconfigdata</source>, the property is not used when running without database).
                    </p>
                    <p>
<source>healthcheck.maintenancefile</source> - The path to a file containing the maintenance state, this file is a
standard Java property file and should have a property (by default named <source>DOWN_FOR_MAINTENANCE</source>").
If this property has the value <source>true</source>, none of the standard health checks will be performed, and instead
the result will be a string of the form <source>MAINT: DOWN_FOR_MAINTENANCE</source>.
If this property is not set (or an invalid file is given), the maintenance functionallity is disabled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
<source>healthcheck.maintenancepropertyname</source> - The property name to be used in the maintenance file. This will also
affect the error message returned when in maintenance mode (the part of the string after <source>MAINT: </source>
(defaults to <source>DOWN_FOR_MAINTENANCE</source>).
                    </p>

        <section name="The old Web Services interface" shortname="signserverws">
                <p>
The SignServerWS is the old web services interface now replaced by SignServer ClientWS. It was 
new to version 3.0 and at the time replaced the RMI-SSL interface from version 1.0 and 2.0 for two reasons, the RMI-SSL were based on a commercial library and it only worked for Java clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
The SignServerWS WSDL file is located at the URL http://&lt;hostname&gt;:8080/signserver/signserverws/signserverws?wsdl
                    </p>
                    <p>
The interface has two calls, the main one is 'process' which takes a collection of process request to a processable worker and returns a collection of process responses, the second one is getStatus that performs a health check of the node and returns an OK message if the node is healthy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Notice:</b>
All though the SignServerWS interface uses web services the actual process data is base64 encoded byte arrays in a special binary format. You will have to lookup the Java source code for the exact format of the request and response data. An alternative is to instead use the much simpler <a href="#Web%20Server%20Interface">Web Server Interface</a> or the newer <a href="#Client%20Web%20Service">ClientWS interface</a>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
The getStatus call can be used to implement high-availability towards the client. The Java client API described in the next section have built in support for different high availability policies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
It's possible to turn off the WebService interface by disabling it in the build configuration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
This interface is only supported using HTTPS. The reason is that JBoss 4 does not rewrite the protocol part of the WSDL URL so we had to hard code it for it to work with HTTPS. For details about this see <a href="https://jira.primekey.se/browse/DSS-327">DSS-327</a>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
Since SignServer >=3.2.1 it is possible to supply extra request data called RequestMetadata containing key/value pairs that can be used by the signers. For instance the PDFSigner uses this feature to let the client supply a PDF password. 
                    </p>
        </section>

		<section name="Java Client API">
                    <p>
Built along with the WebService is a Java API that can be used by clients. It's available in the file lib/SignServer-Client-SignServerWS.jar (the old SignServerWS interface) and lib/SignServer-Client-ClientWS.jar (the ClientWS interface). 
                    </p>

		<section name="SigningAndValidation API">
			<p>
				The SigningAndValidation API is a wrapper around the previous
				mentioned API in order to have a simplified interface that also
				is the same regardless if WebService or EJB Remote calls are used.
			</p>

				To use the API include the file lib/SignServer-Client-SigningAndValidationAPI.jar.

                    <p>
The SignServer AdminWS can be used for remote administration of SignServer
over client authenticated HTTPS. Access is granted based on a list of
certificate serial number and issuer distinguished name pairs. Currently there
is only one access level and all administrators granted access will be able to
perform all operations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
The WSDL file is located at the URL http://&lt;hostname&gt;:8080/signserver/AdminWSService/AdminWS?wsdl
                    </p>
                    <p>
Authorizing administrators can be done using the Admin CLI command "wsadmins".
                    </p>
                    <source>
Usage: signserver wsadmins -add -certserialno &lt;certificate serial number&gt; -issuerdn &lt;issuer DN&gt;
Usage: signserver wsadmins -remove -certserialno &lt;certificate serial number&gt; -issuerdn &lt;issuer DN&gt;
Usage: signserver wsadmins -list
Example 1: signserver wsadmins -add -certserialno 123abcdef -issuerdn "C=SE, CN=Neo Morpheus"
Example 2: signserver wsadmins -remove -certserialno 123abcdef -issuerdn "C=SE, CN=Neo Morpheus"
Example 3: signserver wsadmins -list
                    </source>
                    <p>
Notice that the certificate serial number should be entered with lower case characters. 
Also notice that the issuer DN currently should be entered in the reversed order 
and with spaces after each component. In the example above the issuer DN from the 
certificate actually is "CN=Neo Morpheus, C=SE". 
                    </p>
                    <p>
To troubleshoot an "Administrator not authorized to resource" see the logs for how 
SignServer interprets the serialnumber and subject DN. Example:

                <section name="Apache HTTP Server as proxy">
                    <p>
This section will show you examples on how the Apache Web Server (version 2.2.20) can be used as a proxy in front of SignServer. This guide is only informative, you should also always consult the current Apache documentation for the modules used. The proxy could be used for multiple reasons including:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use standard ports (80, 443) instead of unprivileged ports used by the application server</li>
                        <li>Making workers accessible through more nice looking URLs.<br/>For example "http://tsa.example.com" instead of "http://example.com:8080/signserver/tsa?workerName=TimeStampSigner1"</li>
                        <li>Use any of the access control and authentication mechanism available in Apache</li>
                        <li>Redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS</li>
                        <li>Only accepting requests to specified locations</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
As the requests should go through the proxy you will probably want to configure the application server to only listen to localhost and/or use a firewall blocking the application server ports from external requests. To configure JBoss to only listen to localhost set the following properties in signserver_build.properties:
                    </p>
                    <source>
httpsserver.bindaddress.pubhttp=127.0.0.1
httpsserver.bindaddress.pubhttps=127.0.0.1
httpsserver.bindaddress.privhttps=127.0.0.1
                </source>
                    <p>
Install the Apache web server and enable required modules (the following commands are for Ubuntu but should be similar in other distributions as well):
                    </p>
                <source>

                    <p>
The following example configures three virtual hosts. The first signserver.example.com:80 just redirects all requests to use HTTPS and thus the virtual host signserver.example.com:443. The second virtual host is configured to proxy requests to the /signserver path on the application server using the AJP protocol. It is also configured to use HTTPS with a server certificate. The last virtual hosts auth.signserver.example.com using an additonal IP address is configured to require client certificate authentication. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
Notice: Some application servers (i.e. JBoss 4) might have problems writing the correct port number in the endpoint URL in the web services WSDL file when using a proxy (i.e. writing 8443 instead of 443).

                <subsection name="Example: Granting access to specific workers only">
                    <p>
This example shows how it is possible to limit access to only specified resources. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
If you are going to grant different users access to different workers always remember to first deny access from the root location. The reason is that there are other ways to access a worker than the "/worker/*" pattern. For instance /process, /tsa, /pdf and /sod etc as well as using the web services interfaces /signserverws, /SignServerWSService, /validationws, /ValidationWSService and /ClientWSService all can be used to invoke <b>any</b> worker.
                    </p>
                    <p>
If you instead relay on SignServer to do the authentication/authorization it could still be good from a security point to only grant access to the locations you intend to use. In that case you would probably want to also give access to the  web services interfaces, /worker and /process etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
Also remember if you are proxying from multiple virtual hosts (i.e. if you have one with and one without client authentication as in the example above) that you might want to add the access restrictions to all of them.

This authorizer requires a valid username and password. User accounts are
configured by setting properties of the form shown above, where
[NAME] is the username and [PASSWORD] is the clear-text password. In the second
form [HASHED_PASSWORD] should be replaced with the output of the digest algorithm 
specified in [HASH_ALGORITHM]. The third form uses a hash value that is appended 
to the password before hashing it.

                        <p>

If a worker is invoked directly using an EJB call and no REMOTE_IP is specified
in the RequestContext the IP-address is set to the String "null". In that case,
to allow requests using EJB calls, null can be added to the list of allowed
addresses.

<b>Note:</b> When adding "null" to ALLOW_FROM not only locally running clients
like the ClientCLI and AdminGUI is allowed access but also from workers that
invoke the other worker directly using an EJB call. This is for instance the
case for the XMLValidator which delegates the validation of the certificate to
a CertValidator. If the CertValidator had a RemoteAddressAuthorizer allowing
access from "null" then the XMLValidator would be able to use it. To restrict
users from using the CertValidator (indirectly through the XMLValidator) an
Autorizer could be configured for the XMLValidator.

It is not possible to specify both a whitelist and a black list at the same time for each of direct and forwarded addresses.
One of each list (direct and forwarded) must be specified.
When specifying a whitelist for forwarded addresses, requests without an X-Forwarded-For header will always be denied.
When there are multiple addresses in the X-Forwarded-For header (in the case of using multiple proxies) the number of addresses specified in
MAX_FORWARDED_ADDRESSES counting from the end of the list (or the entire list if it is shorter than this) is considered for white- and blacklisting.
If specified, MAX_FORWARDED_ADDRESSES must have a value >= 1. It is not allowed to set it 0 to disable checking forwarded addresses.
RemoteAddressAuthorizer should be used in this case.
                        </p>

Examples:
                        </p>
                        <p>
1. To accept requests from all direct addresses except for 10.0.0.5 and for all forwarded addresses except 13.170.18.12 and 13.170.18.13 use:<br/>
BLACKLISTED_DIRECT_ADDRESSES=10.0.0.5<br/>
BLACKLISTED_FORWARDED_ADDRESSES=13.170.18.12, 13.170.18.13
                        </p>
                        <p>
2. To only accept direct requests from 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.2 and from the forwarded address 216.34.181.97 use:<br/>
WHITELISTED_DIRECT_ADDRESSES=10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2<br/>
WHITELISTED_FORWARDED_ADDRESS=216.34.181.97
                        </p>
                        <p>
3. To only allow direct access from the proxy servers 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.2 but allow them to forward from all address except the to banned addresses 13.170.18.12 and 13.170.18.13 use:<br/>

WHITELISTED_FORWARDED_ADDRESS=216.34.181.97
                        </p>
                        <p>
5. To accept direct request from a proxy server 10.0.1.1 allowing forwarding from another proxy 10.0.2.2 in turn proxying the request from the
client with address 192.0.43.10 use:<br/>
WHITELISTED_DIRECT_ADDRESSES=10.0.1.1<br/>
WHITELISTED_FORWARDED_ADDRESSES=10.0.2.2,192.0.43.10<br/>
MAX_FORWARDED_ADDRESSES=2
                        </p>
                        <p>
6. To blacklist a set of IP addresses, set the MAX_FORWARDED_ADDRESSES value to a value gauranteed to be larger than the number of
proxies you have control over, like in the following example:
BLACKLISTED_FORWARDED_ADDRESSES=10.0.1.1,10.0.2.2,10.0.3.3
MAX_FORWARDED_ADDRESSES=10
                        </p>

(if it's available in the request) in the log field AUTHORIZED_FORWARDED_ADDRESS.

            <section name="Checking validity of signer certificates">
                <p>
By default the SignServer checks if the signer certificate of a signer is valid before letting the signer process a request. If the signers certificate is not valid an error message is returned.
There are two properties that can be set to disable this check:
                </p>
                <p>
<b>CHECKCERTVALIDITY</b>: default value is true, meaning that the validity period of the certificate will be verified before processing. Set to false to ignore if the certificate is expired or not yet valid.
                </p>
                <p>
<b>CHECKCERTPRIVATEKEYVALIDITY</b>: default value is true, meaning that the validity period in the PrivateKeyUsagePeriod of the certificate will be verified before processing. This is only done if this extension exists (it is optional in a certificate). Set to false to ignore the PrivateKeyUsagePeriod.
                </p>
                <p>
<b>MINREMAININGCERTVALIDITY</b>: default value is 0. This property defines a minimum remaining validity time required of the signing certificate. If the signing certificate expires within the number of days specified an error occurs. Set to 0 (default) to disable this check.
				</p>
            </section>

			<section name="Limiting the number of signatures">
                <p>
By default SignServer keeps track of the number of signings performed with each key by holding counters in the database that are updated for each signing. The following worker properties controls the key usage counter:    
                </p>
                <p>
<b>KEYUSAGELIMIT</b> = Sets how many signatures that are allowed to be created
with the same key by this worker (default is -1 = no limit). After the limit has
been reached the worker is considered offline.

Note that the counter is per key and not per worker so if multiple workers share
the same key they will all increment the counter. This also means that the worker
is active again after it has gotten a new certificate/key.
                </p>
                <p>
<b>DISABLEKEYUSAGECOUNTER</b> = By default all key usages are counted but by specifying this as "TRUE" key usages performed by this worker will not be counted. Disabling the key usage counter can be a gain in performance as it will be less database transactions. However, if you have requirements on the number of allowed signings for one worker make sure to not use the same key with another worker for which the counter is disabled as those uses will then be missed.
                </p>
                <p>
The key usage counter can not be disabled for a worker if KEYUSAGELIMIT is also specified.
                </p>
			</section>
            
            <section name="Other properties">
                <p>
<b>DISABLED</b> = Setting this to true disables a worker. A disabled worker can not perform any operations and any requests to it will fail. However, disabled workers are not included in the Health check report. 
                </p>
                <p>
<b>EXPLICITECC</b> = Setting this to true uses explicit domain parameters instead of NamedCurves when generating
a certificate request using the RenewalWorker or through to admin GUI. (default: false)

There exists multiple signers. One is the time stamp signer generating RFC 3161 compliant timestamps using the Bouncycastle library.
An MRTD signer creating "Machine Reader Travel Document" signatures using the RSA algorithm from pre-padded data and
another is the MRTD SOD Signer which creates the complete Security Object (SOd) by signing the datagroups for the passport.
There are also signers for automatically signing of specific document-types 
such as PDF, XML, ODF and OOXML and there is a general purpose signer that
can sign any document-type and produces the output in Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS).

<b>INCLUDE_CERTIFICATE_LEVELS</b> = Number of certificate levels to include. This property is supported for all signers except MRTDSODSigner, MRTDSigner, and MSAuthCodeTimeStampSigner. The property is optional and defaults to include all certificates in the chain, except for XAdESSigner, where the default is to only include one certificate (the signing certificate). Setting this to 0 (include no certificates) is not supported for TimeStampSigner. To include all certificates specify at least the same value as number of certificates in the certificate chain.

The MRTD SOD Signer creates the complete security object (SOd) for a MRTD (Machine Readable Travel Document, i.e. electronic passports, residence permit etc) by signing the provided data groups (DGs).
                        </p>
                        <p>
Note 1: The Document Signer (DS) certificate is included in the SOd.<br/>
Note 2: The SOd is verified (including certificate path) before it is returned so the certificate chain must contain the Country Signing CA (CSCA) certificate.<br/>
Note 3: See also the integration guide for <a href="complete.en.html#SODProcessServlet">SODProcessServlet</a> or the <a href="complete.en.html#Client%20Web%20Service">ClientWS</a> interface.

                <subsection name="PDF Signer">
                    <p>
The PDF signer has the class name: org.signserver.module.PDFSigner
                    </p>

                    <subsubsection name="Overview">
                        <p>
The main purpose of the PDF signer is to add digital signatures to PDF documents. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
The signer supports the addition of visible or invisible signatures. Both visible and invisible signatures serve the same purpose of signing document, and technically are equivalent in that sense. The difference is that when visible signature  is applied to a document, signature image (in shape of rectangle) is placed at the specified place in the document, clicking on which will allow seeing properties of the signature (Adobe Acrobat Reader). On the other hand when invisible signature is applied, signature properties are accessed through menu items. For visible signatures properties such as : custom signature image, signature rectangle, page at which signature rectangle to be drawn and others can be specified (see Available Properties below)
                        </p>
                        <p>
PDF Signer can also apply timestamp to a signature. If the signature is timestamped, it can be viewable through signature properties in Adobe Acrobat Reader. Timestamping is used to prove that  document was signed before the time specified by timestamp token. If the signature is not timestamped then the signature time specified in the signature properties is not considered to be trusted. It is strongly advised to apply timestamp to a signature, and the TSA module can be used for this purpose.
                        </p>
                        <p>
Also CRL or OCSP Response of the signer's certificate can be embedded inside the signature package. Embedding CRL or OCSP response with the package will help validate signature even after the signer's certificate is expired. (Though it will not totally guarantee the long term signature preservation. Topic of long term signature preservation for archival purposes is a large one and is discussed to be implemented in future versions of SignServer).
                        </p>
                        <p>
The PDF Signer can also be configured to enforce that certain PDF permissions are not available in the signed document and/or that certain permissions should be removed.
                        </p>
                    </subsubsection>
                    
                    <subsubsection name="PDF passwords">
                        <p>
PDF documents can optionally be protected by a password.
                        </p>
                        <p>
There are two different types of passwords:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    User password:<br/>
                                    Also sometimes referred to as "open password" or "document password". It can be used for reading an encrypted document.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Owner password:<br/>
                                    Also sometimes referred to as "permission password" or "security restriction password". It can be used for reading an encrypted document and making changes to a document that has permissions.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
If a document is protected by an owner password it has to be supplied with the request for SignServer to sign the document. If the document is protected by a user password, either the user password or the owner password has to be supplied with the request for SignServer to sign the document.
                        </p>
                    </subsubsection>
                    
                    <subsubsection name="PDFSigner Requests">
                        <p>
PDF signing requests can be served using either web services or the web server interface (HTTP). See <a href="integration.html">Integration</a> for general information about the different interfaces.    
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
For the web server interface the GenericProcessServlet can be used. The PDFSigner supports the extra request field "pdfPassword" letting the client supply a PDF password to be used for opening the PDF for signing (not required unless the PDF is already password protected).
                        </p>
                        <p>
For the old web services interface the request should contain an encoded GenericProcessesRequest and the response will be an GenericProcessResponse. It is possible to supply a PDF password by including it in the requestMetaData with the key "pdfPassword".
                        </p>

Notice: This property only removes the permissions listed even if some permissions (i.e. ALLOW_PRINTING) by the standard gives more permissions (i.e. also ALLOW_DEGRADED_PRINTING).

ODF Signer, which stands for Open Document Format Signer is a plug-in to SignServer that applies server side signature to documents in ODF format. It has been tested with OpenOffice.org 3.1.
                        </p>

                <p>
The validation service framework is used to validate certificates from one or more issuers. It can be used to  have one central point of performing revokation statuses to simplify the integration of external PKIs within an enterprise.
                </p>
                <p>
The validation service framework also provides a validation cache that can be used to increase performance for those cases a application does multiple lookups of the same certificate within a short period of time.

                <p>
Out-of-the-Box there exists a DefaultValidationService that should satisfy most use cases but it's possible to develop a custom ValidationService if necessary. See the developer section for more details.

All Validation Services is configured by specifying the org.signserver.validationservice.server.ValidationServiceWorker in the global configuration, then is the actual ValidationService configured in the worker configuration setting the class path in the property TYPE (Not necessary for the DefaultValidationService).
                </p>
                <p>
The validation service framework is mostly used with X509v3 certificates but other kinds of certificates is supported as well by design.
                </p>
                <p>
Another concept in the Validation Service Framework is that the client also can ask the service to check the type of certificate that the certificate might be used for. A certificate type could be IDENTIFICATION or ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE.

                        <p>
The default validation service have a set of Validators. A validator is responsible to checking the validity against one or more issuers using for example CRL check or OCSP/XKMS lookup or just by checking some database. Currently there are no ready to use validators, these remain to be developed in future versions of the SignServer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
The Default Validation Service supports validations to be cached for some or all issuers for a specified amount of time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
If not configured otherwise will the validation service use the DefaultX509CertTypeChecker that determines the certificate type from the key usage in the certificate.  Key Encipherment and Digital Signature indicates a IDENTIFICATION type and Non-reputation and/or Digital Signature indicates ELECTRONIC_SIGNATURE.
                        </p>
                        <p>
There exists a validation specific WebService that can be used for platform independent client calls.
The WebService must be enabled during the build and isn't by default. The WebService WSDL file is located at the URL http://&lt;hostname&gt;:8080/signserver/validationws/validationws?wsdl and it contains two calls one is 'isValid' that performs the validation check and the other is a getStatus call that checks the health of the node and its underlying systems. The last calls can be used by clients for monitoring or implementing redundancy.

Validator properties is specified with the prefix of 'validator&lt;validatorId&gt;.' or 'val&lt;validatorId&gt;.' were validator Id should be an integer between 1 and 255. For instance, to specify the type of a validator with an id of 1 then specify 'val1.classpath=some.classpath.SomeClass'. This validator will be initialized with all its validator specific properties (with 'val&lt;id&gt;.' prefix removed) as well as the general ones.
                        </p>

A Timed Service (formerly called just service) is a task that is run on a timely basis, performing maintenance tasks like changing active key, or it could generate a report.
                </p>
                <p>
A Timed Service framework supports a couple basic properties that is used to calculate when and how a timed service should run. These properties are:
                </p>
                <p>
<b>ACTIVE</b> =  "TRUE" if the service should be run, otherwise it is disabled.
                </p>
                <p>
<b>SINGLETON</b> =  "TRUE" if the service only should be run on one of the nodes in the cluster at the time. If it's not set or set to FALSE is the service run simultaneously on all nodes in the cluster. If the node running a singleton service fails will another node sense this and start up the service.
                </p>
                <p>
<b>INTERVAL</b> = Property defining the interval in seconds the service should run.
                </p>
                <p>
<b>INTERVALMS</b> = Property defining the interval in milliseconds the service
should run. Notice that the platform and application server might put a lower
bound on the value. The lower limit for GlassFish is by default 7000 milliseconds
but can be changed by editing minimum-delivery-interval-in-millis in domain.xml.
                </p>
                <p>
<b>CRON</b> = Property that should define a CRON expression of how often the service should run.  It should conform to Unix CRON standard. (One and only one of INTERVAL, INTERVALMS or CRON is required)

The SignerStatusReportTimedService is a timed service that outputs status for a
set of workers to a file. The information includes each workers crypto token status
ACTIVE/OFFLINE and if available also the numbers of signatures that has been
performed with the key currently associated with the worker. If the worker has
a configured limit of number of signatures, this value is also included. See 
also the <a href="#SignerStatusReportWorker">SignerStatusReportWorker</a> which

The RenewalWorker can be used for generation a new key-pair and renewing a worker's certificate from EJBCA using web services (WS). The RenewalWorker should be configured with its own CryptoToken and an SSL client authentication certificate with permissions set up in EJBCA to issue certificates. Some properties are configured for the RenewalWorker such as the EJBCA WS endpoint URL and truststore details, other properties should be set on the worker that should be renewed (the renewee) and some arguments are provided when the worker is invoked.

                    <p>
Known limitation: It might not be possible to have multiple renewal workers using different crypto tokens because the keys and certificates used by the TLS connection for the web service is setup globally.

                    <p>
The RenewalWorker starts by generating a new key-pair (unless an NEXTCERTSIGNKEY is already set for the renewee or the request property FORDEFAULTKEY=true is set in the request). The HSM/keystore password needs to be submitted as part of the request (AUTHCODE request property) to generate a new key-pair. After the key-pair has been generated and tested successfully the key alias is set as the NEXTCERTSIGNKEY property. A certificate signing request is created for the key and the worker sends the request to EJBCA to issue a certificate for the configured end entity. After receiving the certificate and certificate chain they are installed for the worker and the DEFAULTKEY property is updated with the value from NEXTCERTSIGNKEY and that property is removed.

Using PKCS11 it's possible to use a HSM that has a PKCS11 module, such as Utimaco, nCipher, SafeNet or AEP KeyPer. SignServer uses the same underlying implementation of
PKCS11 crypto tokens as EJBCA. To find out more about supported devices and get information how to configure them you can visit the HSM documentation at <a href="http://ejbca.org/adminguide.html#Hardware%20Security%20Modules%20%28HSM%29">EJBCA.org</a>. 
The only thing that differs are the token labels strings, which you should use from below for SignServer. A very useful tool from EJBCA is the <a href="http://ejbca.org/userguide.html#EJBCA%20client%20toolbox">ClientToolBox</a>. 
If you can generate anbd test PKCS11 keys using the clientToolBox, you can use them with SignServer.

Edit qs_pdfsigner_configuration.properties and choose the sign token setting for the PKCS11 sign token. Run the following command to set up a PDF signer using the PKCS11 properties configured:
bin/signserver setproperties qs_pdfsigner_configuration.properties
                        </p>
                        <p>
Generate a keypair for the signer:
bin/signserver generatekey 8 -alias defaultKey -keyalg RSA -keyspec 2048
                        </p>
                        <p>
Test the keypair:

                        </p>
                        <p>
You also need a certificate for the signer. Generate a certificate request with the command:
bin/signserver generatecertreq 8 "CN=PKCS11 Signer token" SHA1WithRSA /tmp/certreq.pem
                        </p>

Add a user in EJBCA with a certificate profile suitable for signing, and enrol for a "Server Certificate" using the public web pages.

                        <p>
Create the certificate chain file with the command:
cat /tmp/cert.pem /tmp/AdminCA1.pem > /tmp/certchain.pem
                        </p>
                        <p>
The signer certificate must be first, and the root CA certificate last.
                        </p>
                        <p>
Upload the signing certificate chain to the signer using the command:
bin/signserver uploadsignercertificatechain 8 GLOB /tmp/certchain.pem
                        </p>
                        <p>
After the certificate chain has been uploaded to the server, the configuration must be reloaded and the server must be restarted. It is not sufficient to only reload the configuration.

The SoftCryptoToken is a simple token managing it's own soft keys instead of using a PKCS12 file. It can be used for test and demonstration purposes. The keys are stored in the worker's properties and is generated when genCertificateRequest is called. One key is used for all purposes and a new key is generated for every certificate request.

        <chapter name="Development" shortname="development">
            <p>
This section describes the details of how to develop your own plug-ins for the SignServer API. It goes through most of the necessary interfaces to get going.
            </p>
            <p>
See also doc/DEVELOP.txt.                
            </p>
            
            <section name="Custom modules">
                <p>
Custom code can be included in the SignServer build process by placing the projects under the modules directory and adhere to the modules contract.    
                </p>
                <p>
First, the property modules.build.includes in res/modules-project.properties defines which projects that should be included in the build process. All projects with a folder name starting with SignServer-Module-*, SignServer-ejb* or SignServer-war are included. Other patterns can be included by setting a property extra.modules.build.includes.
                </p>
                <p>
Second, in the project folder there should be an Ant script called build.xml.    
                </p>
                <p>
Third, if the project should be called it should define the properties:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>modulename</b>: The name of the module. Will be used as prefix to the enable-property. Example: module.pdfsigner (the enable property will then be module.pdfsigner.enabled)</li>
                        <li><b>clean.available</b>: True if the "clean" target should be called when the rest of SignServer is getting cleaned.</li>
                        <li><b>dist-module.available</b>: True if the "dist-module" target should be called when SignServer is getting built</li>
                    </ul>
                    Example:
                </p>
                <pre>
&lt;property name="modulename" value="module.pdfsigner"/&gt;
&lt;property name="clean.available" value="true"/&gt;
&lt;property name="dist-module.available" value="true"/&gt;    
                </pre>
                <p>
Forth, the dist-module target should take care of moving all distributables to the ../../lib directory and if the module should be deployed as part of the signserver.ear file a module descriptor should be placed in ../../mods-available. The name of the descriptor file should be priority_modulename.properties where priority is the order in which the module should be built and modulename is the name as defined by the property with the same name.
                </p>
                <p>
The priorities are basically like this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>10: Essential core modules (like signserverejb and signservercommon)</li>
                        <li>20: Other core modules (like web services)</li>
                        <li>30: Other core modules (like web components etc)</li>
                        <li>40: Other modules (like signers/validators etc)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
The module descriptor can contain:
                    <ul>
                        <li>module.name: Same as the modulename property</li>
                        <li>module.type: The type of the module. "lib" if the module should be put in signserver.ear/lib, "ejb" if it is an EJB module or "war" if it is and WAR module.</li>
                        <li>to.root: Comma separated list of files to move to the root of signserver.ear. Basedir is SIGNSERVER_HOME and all files should be taken from lib/ (not modules/ as it is not available in the binary distribution).</li>
                        <li>to.lib: Same as to.root but for jar files to be moved to signserver.ear/lib/.</li>
                        <li>module.ejb: Only if module.type is "ear" or "war". The name of the enterprise module file (example: signserver.war).</li>
                        <li>module.web.web-uri: Only if module.type is "war". The name to put in the web-uri part of the application.xml for this enterprise module.</li>
                        <li>module.web.context-root: Only if module.type is "war". The name to put in the context-root part of the application.xml for this enterprise module.</li>
                        <li>postprocess.files: Optionally. Comma separated list of property name prefixes for each file to postprocess (example: postprocess.file1)</li>
                        <li>postprocess.file1.src: Only if postprocess.files specified. Path of file to postprocess (relative to SIGNSERVER_HOME/lib/, example: SignServer-ejb-SignServerWS.jar)</li>
                        <li>postprocess.file1.includes: Only if postprocess.files. Ant includes pattern with files in the jar to postprocess (example: META-INF/ejb-jar.xml)</li>
                        <li>postprocess.file1.dest: Only if postprocess.files specified. Location to put the resulting JAR in the final EAR. Default "" (the root) but should be set to "lib/" for library JARs.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Example (mods-available/40_module.pdfsigner.properties):

           <section name="Custom CLI">
               <p>
The SignServer AdminCLI or ClientCLI can be extended by putting additional JAR files with custom implementations of the ClientCommandFactory or AdminCommandFactory interfaces on the classpath. The implementation classes should be listed in the JAR files under META-INF/services in a file with the full class name of the interface. See SignServer-Client-ValidationCLI as an example.

                <p>
The main component in the SignServer is the Worker from which most other components inherits. To get a better overview of how the different component types relate to one and another see illustration 1 in the Overview section.
                </p>
                <p>
Most workers work in the same way but with different interfaces to implement but for all of them should the following steps be performed.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
Create a custom  class implementing the specified interface. There usually exists a base class implementing the most basic function to simply the implementation even further. If it exists it's recommended to inherit it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
You can define your own properties that the worker can use for its configuration.
                    </li>
                    <li>
Make sure the custom class is available to the application server
                    </li>
                    <li>
Redeploy the SignServer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
Register the worker in the application by setting a property WORKER&lt;id&gt;.CLASSPATH with a global scope in the global configuration. (Also make sure to set it's crypto tokens class-path, see separate section).
                    </li>
                    <li>
Reload the service with the CLI reload command.

                        <p>
A Signer is a component used to perform some form of cryptographic processing of requested data and to create a custom signer class it should  implement the org.signserver.server.signers.ISigner interface. There exists a BaseSigner that can be inherited taking care of some of the functionality. If the BaseSigner is inherited the only method that needs to be implemented is 'processData() '.
                        </p>
                        <p>
There exists a DummySigner implementation that is used for demonstration purposes.
                        </p>

                    <subsubsection name="The ITimedService Interface">
                        <p>
There are two kinds of timed services, singleton or non-singleton. A singleton service is only run at one of the nodes at the time while non-singleton services are run at all nodes simultaneously. If a singleton service fails to run on one of the nodes will one of the other nodes take over the service
automatically.
                        </p>
                        <p>
If a service should be singleton or not is determined by a standard property SINGLETON defined
in the ServiceConfig class.
                        </p>
                        <p>
Other basic properties used to configure all services are:
ACTIVE when set to "TRUE" means that the service is active and should be run.
INTERVAL defining the interval in seconds of how often the service should be run.
INTERVALMS defining the interval in milliseconds of how often the service should be run.
CRON used instead of INTERVAL or INTERVALMS to specify on a calendar basis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
To create a custom timed service class it should implement the org.signserver.server.timedservices.ITimedService interface. There exists a BaseTimedService that can be inherited taking care of most of the basic functionality. If the BaseTimedService is inherited the the only method that needs to be implemented is the 'work()' method.
                        </p>
                        <p>
The work method that needs to be implemented is described here:

                        <pre>
/**
 * Method that should do the actual work and should

                    <subsubsection name="IValidationService Interface">
                        <p>
Just as the other worker plug-ins have the validator service a base class taking care of most of the common methods and the only method that needs to be implemented is the 'validate' method below. But for most applications should the DefaultValidationService work. What is probably more interesting is to develop a custom IValidator used to integrate the default validation service against different certificate status repositories. See section called 'Other Customizations' for details of how to implement a Validator.

            <section name="The Global Configuration Store">
                <p>
The available workers and its crypto tokens and services is configured in something called the global configuration store that is slightly different from a worker configuration.
                </p>
                <p>
Is is dynamically configured and activated immediately. I can contain any type of data (in string representation) and can be of two types, either with global scope or node scope. A Global scoped property can be accessed by  all nodes in the cluster while a Node scoped property in only used within a node and cannot be accessed by the other nodes.
                </p>
                <subsection name="SignServer specific">
                    <p>
Database failure is handled differently. If a node looses connection to the database it put itself in a state called 'unsynchronised' and will continue its operation without storing the data to database by using a cached global configuration. It is possible to later resynchronise one nodes cached global configuration data  with the database with a CLI command called 'resync'. But it is only possible to sync one of the nodes global configuration to the database.
                    </p>
                </subsection>
            </section>

            <section name="Status Repository">
                <p>
The status repository holds non-persistent local (per JVM) status information (properties) with optional expiration times. After the expiration time the property is not returned. The value is also not preserved among server restarts. 
                </p>
                <p>
This could be used by having workers read the status from the repository while an external (or internal) service periodically updates it. The (optional) expiration time on the values makes it possible to detect if an periodic service has failed to update the value within the specified time.
                </p>
                <p>
From the Admin CLI the status repository can be controlled using the <i>getstatusproperties</i>, <i>getstatusproperty</i> and <i>setstatusproperty</i> commands.

            <section name="Logging">
                <p>
SignServer uses Log4j for debug logging and the security events logger from CESeCore 
for system/audit logging. In addition the worker logger (transaction log) can be configured 
to use Log4j and/or the security events logger.
                </p>

                <subsection name="Worker Log">
                    <p>
The purpose of the Worker Loggers are to log each transaction handled by the
worker. Each worker can choose to have its own configuration for the logger. By
default the AllFieldsWorkerLogger is used which used logs all the available
fields one after each other separated by semi colons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
Which Worker Logger configuration to use is configured by setting the
<b>WORKERLOGGER</b> property to the full class name of the IWorkerLogger
implementation in the worker's configuration.
                    </p>
                    <subsubsection name="AllFieldsWorkerLogger">
                        <p>
The default worker logger for most workers. Can be used during testing to find 
which fields a worker logs and then changed to the PatternWorkerLogger with only 
does fields that are of interest chosen.<br/>
LOGLEVEL_DEFAULT sets the level at which
the logger will do log output. These are specified as standard Log4J levels
(FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, and TRACE), if not set, it defaults to INFO.

The properties LOGINCLUDEFIELDS and LOGEXCLUDEFIELDS can be used to restrict the fields included in additionalDetails by explicitly setting a
comma-separated list of field names. Only one of these options can be set at a time.

The purpose of the system log is to log events concerning the SignServer application but not necessarily related to any signing transaction (that is covered by the Worker Log).

For details see the table of events below.<br/>
From version 3.4.0 SignServer uses the CESeCore library to perform audit logging.

By default the Status Repository produces a log entry for every update. This can 
be disabled or changed in the configuration so that only changes are 
logged. See the property <i>statusrepository.log</i> in 
signserver_build.properties.sample.

            <section name="SignServer without Database">
                <p>
Since SignServer 3.2.3 it is sometimes possible to operate SignServer without a database management system and instead rely on SignServer to manage persistence using local files.
                </p>
                <p>
Notice that all features of SignServer is not supported without having a database and that the performance and scalability characteristics might be different. Currently archiving to database is not supported.
                </p>
                <p>
To increase throughput it is recommended to disable the key usage counter as every request would otherwise have to lock and update that file. See the property DISABLEKEYUSAGECOUNTER in the section <a href="complete.en.html#Limiting%20the%20number%20of%20signatures">Limiting the number of signatures</a>.
                </p>
                
                <subsection name="Configuration">
                    <p>
In signserver_build.properties, set database.type to "nodb".
                    </p>
					<source>
database.type=nodb
					</source>
					<p>
Set the location for the local file-based database.
					</p>
					<source>
database.nodb.location=/path/to/filedb
					</source>
					<p>
Where the path is some location where SignServer can write files. The default value is empty. If an relative path is used it is most likely relative to the application server's working directory.
					</p>
					<p>
This directory should either point to an existing SignServer file database or be completely empty. If the directory is empty, SignServer will create the initial database structure at startup.
					</p>
                </subsection>
                
                <subsection name="Structure of data">
                    <p>
The file based database uses a number of files in the specified directory. Read/write synchronization is handled internally in the application and it is thus  not support to do manual changes to the files while the application server is running. It is normally also not supported to have multiple application servers running with SignServer using the same database directory.
                    </p>

                <subsection name="Migrating to/from database">
                    <p>
The recommended way of migrating either to or from an other database management system without setting up all worker configuration from scratch is do use admin command "dumpproperties" to dump the current configuration to a file and then on the new system use the "setproperties" followed by the reload command for every worker id.
                    </p>
                    <p>
Notice: The dumpproperties command will not include the list of authorized clients so those will have to be setup again in the new system. Check with the admin command "listauthorizedclients" if you have any of those.
