/**
 * <p>An Event is the base element in collecting statistics.
 * This base class records when in time the event started and
 * when it stopped for a particular workerId. It is possible
 * to extend the statistics collection even further adding
 * custom data to the event specific for a particular worker.</p>
 * 
 * <p> To add custom data just define a type to call it and
 * use the addCustomData method. The type should be unique and
 * supported by the tool used to review the statistics. </p>
 * 
 * 
 * <p>It's main methods are start() and stop() that should
 * be called whenever the particular event have started
 * and when it have stopped.</p>
