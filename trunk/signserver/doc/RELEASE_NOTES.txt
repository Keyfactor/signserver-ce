  behaviour it needs to be explicitly enabled in conf/cesecore.properties
  Note: it can not be enabled when using the new one-time crypto and is a
  global setting.

   SHA-256. Explicitly specified algorithms will remain with the specified
   values.

----------------

Bug fixes:
 - Signing is no longer initialized if it is going to be refused 
   in TimeStampSigner.

   Make sure your keys are pointed out with the right name.
   Specifically, if the default sample keystore with alias 'dbstorekey' was
   used it should now be changed to 'dbStoreKey' as that is the correct 
   name in the keystore.

 - There is now a web-based administration interface that by default is 
   enabled and available on an URL like https://localhost:8443/signserver/adminweb.
 - If you are customizing the SignServer public web to be embedded in a frame, 
   note that SignServer now uses the X-FRAME-OPTIONS HTTP header, preventing

    - Fixed spelling typos
    - Fixed unit tests not running automatically
    - Fixed stylesheet on public web pages

Notice:
 - Database changes were introduced. See UPGRADE.txt for details.
 - The way to specify a worker's implementation class name in properties form
   has changed. Previously it was specified as:
   GLOB.WORKER4711.CLASSPATH=org.signserver.module.pdfsigner.PDFSigner
   But now it should be specified as a worker property:
   WORKER4711.IMPLEMENTATION_CLASS=org.signserver.module.pdfsigner.PDFSigner
   Exported configurations might have to be adapted.
   SignServer will try to upgrade existing configurations during startup.
 - Each worker configuration should now contain a worker property TYPE,
   specifying the type of worker such as UNKNOWN, PROCESSABLE, TIMED_SERVICE,
   SPECIAL or CRYPTO_WORKER.
   Existing workers will get this worker property populated during the startup.
   See UPGRADE.txt.
 - Previously deprecated crypto token implementations has been removed: 
   SoftCryptoToken, HardCodedCryptoToken, OldPKCS11CryptoToken, and
   PrimeCardHSMCryptoToken.
   For SoftCryptoToken and HardCodedCryptoToken, used for demonstration purposes,
   use KeystoreCryptoToken with the supplied sample configuration.
   For OldPKCS11CryptoToken, configurations should be upgraded to use
   PKCS11CryptoToken.
 - The TimeStampSigner now generates RFC 5816-compliant time stamps with the
   ESSCertIDv2 attribute. To get the old behavior, specify SHA1 as the certificate
   digest algorithm, using the new CERTIFICATE_DIGEST_ALGORITHM worker property.
 - For the TimeStampSigner the default behavior is now to always require the
   ACCEPTEDPOLICIES property to be set to a list of accepted requested policies
   (or empty to disallow requesting a policy). For backwards-compatibility
   the new ACCEPTANYPOLICY property can be set to the value "true".
 - The old deprecated scripts in the bin folder has been removed. Please, use
   the replacement scripts that has been available since long before:
   admingui.sh   => signserver-gui
   client.sh     => signclient
   signserver.sh => signserver

See ChangeLog.txt for the full list of changes.

SignServer 3.7.3
----------------

Notice:
 - The renewsigner admin CLI command will no longer prompt for an authcode when
   the -authcode CLI argument is omitted, use the new -authprompt option to get
   an interactive prompt. When the authcode is not given (or prompted for), the
   command will not automatically (re)activate the token.

See ChangeLog.txt for the full list of changes.


SignServer 3.7.2
----------------

Bug fixes:
 - Performance: Cache key option now improves performance with network HSM
 - Performance: The response time is improved on some systems

See ChangeLog.txt for the full list of changes.


SignServer 3.7.1
----------------

New features:
    - Java code signing support (including Android).
    - Support for key generation with custom RSA public exponent.

Improvements:
    - Support for large files in Client CLI.
    - Minor performance improvements.
    - Improved output from Client CLI.
    - MRTD signing interface improvements (ePassport).
    - Administration GUI improvements.
    - Improved language in the manuals.

Bug fixes:
    - Security issue in Commons Collections library.
    - Regression: Renewing keys for multiple workers at once did not fully work
      in the Administration GUI.
    - Bin folder can not be put in the PATH environment variable.
    - Username/password not accepted if client certificate presented.
    - The FirstActiveDispatcher logs using the dispatchees fields.
    - 24 other bug fixes.

Notice:
 - The Commons Collections library has been updated to version 3.2.2.
   This fixes a potential security vulnerability in earlier versions.
   See also the relevant "Fix Commons Collections Security issue in JBoss 7
   and earlier" and "Fix Security issues in JBoss EAP" sections of the
   installation guide to make sure the issue is also addressed in the
   application server.

See ChangeLog.txt for the full list of changes.


SignServer 3.7.0
----------------

New features:
 - Indivual keys. Key aliases in crypto tokens can be selected by workers at
   run-time based on the incoming request using the new AliasSelector interface.
   An implementation selecting aliases based on the authenticated user of the
   request is included.

Improvements:

Bug fixes:
 - Crypto token operations in the administration GUI no requires clicking
   outside of the last edited input field to be able to performe the action
   (i.e. when generating keys).

Notice:
 - The SignServer build/deployment configuration file has been renamed from
   signserver_build.properties to signserver_deploy.properties. When upgrading
   from an earlier version the existing configuration file should be renamed
   accordingly. The Ant script will complain if a file with the old name is
   found.
 - The XML Security library has been updated to version 1.5.8 and its 
   dependency to version 2.7.2.
   This fixes a potential security vulnerability in earlier versions.
   See: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0107
   See also the various "Fix XML Security library issue" sections in the
   Install Guide for the extra steps needed when using JBoss 5, 7 and EAP 
   respectively.
 - The new KeystoreInConfigCryptoToken is not supported under GlassFish 2.
 - HardCodedCryptoToken is no longer supported for most use cases. Previously,
   the token could have been configured in Certificate or Document validators
   as those required a token to function. Since long this has not been
   required and if any of your validators has this token configured it should
   be removed or they might give an error.
 - SoftCryptoToken is no longer supported. The token was mainly used for quick
   demo setups but does not support the API in 3.7. Use KeystoreCryptoToken or
   KeystoreInConfigCryptoToken instead.
 - The KeystoreCryptoToken will no longer use the first available key when
   signing if DEFAULTKEY has not been set. Please configure your
   KeystoreCryptoTokens to have a DEFAULTKEY property set.
   Having a defined DEFAULTKEY is not needed if using runtime-decided keys
   (using the AliasSelector interfaces).
 - The old way of specifying PKCS#11 libraries by referencing the path to the
   dynamic library as a worker property for a crypto worker has been
   deprecated in favor of using named library definitions.
   To continue using the old way, you need to make sure there is a defined
   named library using the same path as manually specified by the worker.
   If the library is not among the pre-defined libraries, it is possible to
   add new definitions in the deploy properties.
   For security reasons, it is also possible to disable any of the pre-defined
   library definitions.

See ChangeLog.txt for the full list of changes.

   servers

Bug fixes:
 - Build failure on W7 X64

Notice:
 - Support for the cluster classloader has been deprecated and support for it 
   will be dropped in a future release.
