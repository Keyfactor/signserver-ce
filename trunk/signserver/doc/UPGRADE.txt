UPGRADE
=======

This document describes procedures needed to upgrade from one version of 
SignServer to a new version.
Upgrades within a major version, from 3.2.1 to 3.2.2 for example, are usually 
plug-in upgrades and can be made simply by deploying the new software. See 
RELEASE_NOTES.txt for more information about such upgrades.

Upgrading to a major version might require manual changes in the database
structures. In those cases the changes needed are described below.


General procedures:
-----------------

1. Unpack the new sources
2. Make sure to copy over the configuration from the old installation or 
   use the provided signserver_deploy.properties.sample. Take special care 
   in reading the "Notice:" section of the RELEASE_NOTES.txt to see if any 
   configuration properties changed or some manual procedures in addition to
   those mentioned in this file are needed.
3. Copy over the p12 folder with keystores (if used).
4. See any special instructions for the version you are upgrading below.
5. Build and deploy as described in the installation guide.


From SignServer 4.3.x to SignServer 4.4.x
-----------------------------------------

   (No database changes required)


From SignServer 4.2.x to SignServer 4.3.x
-----------------------------------------

a) Database schema changes: table added:
   - "KeyData"

   Hibernate will try to add this table during startup of the application 
   server. However, if the database user used by the data store does not have 
   enough privileges the table has to be created manually. See 
   doc/sql-scripts/create-tables-signserver-*.sql for the definitions for 
   your DBMS.

b) Pay attention to the changed default values for algorithms as described in 
   notice section of the RELEASE_NOTES.txt.


From SignServer 4.1.x to SignServer 4.2.x
-----------------------------------------

   (No database changes required)


From SignServer 4.0.x to SignServer 4.1.x
-----------------------------------------

   (No database changes required)


From SignServer 3.7.x to SignServer 4.0.x
-----------------------------------------

a) Database schema changes:

Two new columns in the signerconfigdata table were added. Hibernate will try to
 add those columns during startup of the application server. However, if the 
database user used by the data store does not have enough privileges (i.e. no 
alter table rights) the table has to be altered manually:

For Oracle:
ALTER TABLE signerconfigdata ADD signerName VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE signerconfigdata ADD signerType VARCHAR(255);

For MySQL:
ALTER TABLE signerconfigdata ADD signerName VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE signerconfigdata ADD signerType VARCHAR(255);

After manually changing the database schema the application server should 
be restarted.

Note 1: During startup of SignServer each worker configuration will be checked
and if an empty signerName column is found the name will be populated with
the value from the NAME worker property.

Note 2: During startup of SignServer each worker configuration without a
worker type will get a worker type populated by loading the worker and checking
the type of the implementation.


From SignServer 3.6.x to SignServer 3.7.x
-----------------------------------------

a) Configuration file name change:
   Pay attention to the change of file name for the configuration file as
   described in the RELEASE_NOTES.txt.

b) Pay attention to changes needed when using soft keystore crypto tokens
   as described in the RELEASE_NOTES.txt.

c) Pay attention to changes needed for PKCS#11 crypto token library definitions
   as described in the RELEASE_NOTES.txt.

d) Dependency upgraded:

The XML Security library has been updated to version 1.5.8 and its 
dependency to 2.7.2. This requires special handling if JBoss is used. See 
the Notice section of RELEASE_NOTES.txt for details.

e) Dependency upgraded:

The Commons Collections library has been updated to version 3.2.2. This might
also need to be take care of in the application server. See the Notice section
of RELEASE_NOTES.txt for details.


From SignServer 3.5.x to SignServer 3.6.x
-----------------------------------------

   (No database changes required)


From SignServer 3.4.x to SignServer 3.5.x
-----------------------------------------

a) Database schema change: tables removed:
   The following tables are no longer used by SignServer and can optionally be
   removed:
   - "enckeydata"
   - "groupkeydata"

b) Dependency upgraded:

The XML Security library has been updated to version 1.5.7. This requires 
special handling if JBoss 5 is used. See the Notice section of 
RELEASE_NOTES.txt for details.


From SignServer 3.3.x to SignServer 3.4.x
-----------------------------------------

a) Database schema change: table renamed:
   A table was renamed to GlobalConfigData. For Oracle this table was previously 
   called "GLOBALCONFIG" while for all other it was called  
   GlobalConfigurationData.
   
   - "GLOBALCONFIG" was renamed to "GlobalConfigData" (Oracle only)
   - "GlobalConfigurationData" was renamed to "GlobalConfigData" (All other)

   For Oracle:
   RENAME GLOBALCONFIG TO GlobalConfigData;

   For MySQL:
   RENAME TABLE GlobalConfigurationData TO GlobalConfigData;

   Hibernate will not rename this table but add it as a new one. For an 
   existing installation it is instead recommended to manually rename the table 
   (using the RENAME statements described above) to not loose the existing 
   configuration.

b) Database schema change: table added:
   - "AuditRecordData"

   Hibernate will try to add this table during startup of the application 
   server. However, if the database user used by the data store does not have 
   enough privileges the table has to be created manually. See 
   doc/sql-scripts/create-tables-signserver34-*.sql for the  definitions for 
   your DBMS.


From SignServer 3.2.x to SignServer 3.3.x
-----------------------------------------

a) Database schema change:

An new column in the ArchiveData table were added. Hibernate will try to add this
column during startup of the application server. However, if the database user 
used by the data store does not have enough privileges (ie. no alter table 
rights) the table has to be altered manually:

For Oracle:
ALTER TABLE ARCHIVEDATA ADD DATAENCODING NUMBER(10,0);

For MySQL:
ALTER TABLE ArchiveData ADD dataEncoding int(11) DEFAULT NULL;

After manually changing the database schema the application server should 
be restarted.

b) Dependency upgraded:

The BouncyCastle library has been upgraded to version 1.47. Users running 
Oracle JDK and JBoss will have to replace all bc*.jar copied to JBoss with 
the 1.47 version jars available under lib/ext/1.6/.
