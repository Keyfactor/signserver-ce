        Provides classes to create and access ODF styles and ODF style families.
        (DEPRECATED: functionality will be moved to element.style for version 0.8 see <a href="https://odftoolkit.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=72">
        <b>Bug&nbsp;72</b></a>)
        Instances of class OdfStyle represent the style of ODF elements.
        Derived style classes for stylable elements were generated from the RelaxNG schema
        and implement Interfaces which specify their possible style property attributes.
        
        <br>Note:
        Classes OdfListStyle and ListStyle were not generated yet. This will follow in
        upcoming versions. 
        <p>
        The class OdfStyleCollection provides access to all styles used in
        the document. The class OdfDocument uses instances of the OdfStyleCollection
        respectively for default-styles, document-styles and for automatic-styles.	
        <p>
        Each style-family is associated with a set of properties, e.g. style:family="text"
        is associated with a style:text-properties child element. Some style families contain 
        multiple style properties.The associations which properties go with which style
        families were generated from the RelaxNG schema. The class OdfStyleFamily holds a static
        instance for every possible style family which itself contains all possible style 
        property attributes.
        <p>
        <!-- ToDo: update class diagram after style refactoring in 0.8 
        The following class diagram is neither complete nor very detailed. It has the purpose 
        to give a basic overview about how styles are handled by ODFDOM
